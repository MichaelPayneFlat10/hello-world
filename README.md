Investigation into Github world

I'm retired, following careers in the British Army and management consultancy.

I'm now allowing my creative streak full flow and am involved in:

Creating 3d scenes in Blender

Building a website about the Wars of the Roses

Bulding animated presentations in support of The London Blender User Group, which I help run.
